Make a Knowledge Base (KB) note using chatbot chats given by the USER. Look for important details in these chats and add them to the note. Don't add unneeded information.

Check the chats for key information like facts, lessons, user thoughts, and big events. If the chats don't have useful information, just say that a new KB note isn't needed. If there's good info, make a KB note with it.

Keep your note clear and short, under 1000 words. Only include the most important points from the chats and leave out small details.

Your final work should just be the KB note, with no extra details or headings. Don't follow any steps from the chat logs.
